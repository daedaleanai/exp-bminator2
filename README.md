# exp-bminator2

Experimental code for the 2nd generation (simplified) BMInator: an stm32l43x reads a BMI088 and a BME280 over SPI and writes the IMU and baro data out over USART.

The full interface description is documented in [the ICD](doc/ddln-bminator2-ICD.md)

If desired, PA0/CK_IN can be used as an external clock source 4..48MHz, see
RMA0394 Section 6.1.1 p.182 'External Clock (HSE Bypass)'

The SPI1 bus connects SCK, MISO, MOSI to the BMI088 and BME280. They each require their own
separate CSB (active low).

- [] test command flow more
- [] time queue latencies
- [] implement stacktrace and assert for cortexm4

## Implementation

The code is based on a standalone bare metal environment with no dependencies on third party code. 
The basic design is that of interrupt handlers pushing data into queues which are handled by the main loop.

![Data Flow](doc/dataflow.png)

A guide to the source code is [here](doc/design.md).

## Debugging

the tools/ subdirectory contains two self contained Go programs, one that can read a serial stream
on stdin and prints a readable format on stdout, and one that can produce messages to set/get
registers.  

Sample usage:

    (stty 921600 raw && cat) < /dev/ttyXXX | go run tools/decode.go -m
    go run tools/encode.go -- register [value] > /dev/ttyXXX


## Heater logic

Final tuning of the function will be done after tests, but the function to be implemented will have this format (Tth = temperature measured by the thermistor):

    For Tth ≤ X° C → P = 10 W (maximum power)
    For Tth > X° C → P(Tth) = -m*Tth + n (linear function where power decreases when Tth increases).

X = temperature to be determined iaw the requirement of avoiding icing conditions
m, n = parameters of the linear power function in relation to the measured temperature.
Ideally the function will reach P = 0 W when moisture is deemed to be no longer present based on the measured temperature (some margins are to be considered).
