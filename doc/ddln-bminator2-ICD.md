### Nomenclature and Description of Terms

#### Description of Terms

**BMInator v2** 
A small PCB with an STM32L43x microcontroller, a Bosch BMI088 and BME280 sensor and firmware to read out the sensor and output the data over a serial line.  In addition the device contains a current source and analog inputs to control a heater element.

**Host Unit** 
A system interfacing to the BMInator v2, (e.g. a CoaXPress camera).

**MUST** A requirement for the the system.

## System Overview

The Daedalean BMInator v2 contains a Bosch BMI088 MEMS IMU to measure 6-dof motion at up to 1600 Hz(accelerometer) and 2000 Hz(gyroscope) and a Bosch BME280 which senses environmental temperature, pressure and humidity.

A Host Unit must be able to obtain the IMU and environmental data streams from the BMInator and be able to correlate them in time to it's own time reference.  The Host Unit must also be able to read and control settings in the sensors, and store and retrieve up to a kilobyte of data in it's non volatile memory.

In addition the device contains a current source to supply a heater element and an analog input to sense temperature using a thermistor.  The Host Unit can send commands to set the desired temperature.

To this end the BMInator is physically, electically and logically connected to the Host Unit, which can send a time pulse and serial commands, and receives a timestamped datastream with the measurements, and responses to the commands.


### Functional overview

This document defines the physical, electrical and data interfaces carried over the connections from BMInator to Host Unit to achieve the following functionality:

1. The BMInator is powered from the Host Unit,
2. The BMInator receives a reference time pulse from the Host Unit in order to correlate these events to its internal timer,
3. The BMInator can receive commands over a serial port from the Host Unit,
4. The BMInator transmits a stream of event messages with IMU, health and timing information, over a serial port to the Host Unit.
5. The BMInator transmits responses to commands over the same serial port. 
6. The BMInator supplies up to 10W of power to a heater element to maintain a preset temperature of an external heating element.
7. The BMInator's firmware can be updated in a fail-safe atomic way. 

## Physical interface

A reference implementation of the BMInator is a PCB of XXxXXmm, with YY Mx screw holes and 3 connectors according to the following image:

The electrical characteristics of PA9, PA10 and PA15 are described in the STM32L43x Datasheet section 5.

## Logical Interface

### Host Unit Time Pulse Reference Signal

The time pulse reference is a digital signal provided by the Host Unit to the BMInator, which times the level changes.
The BMInator will emit messages correlating the raise and fall events to its internal clock with a resolution of 1 microsecond.

This function can be used to correlate the measurement data with a camera shutter opening and closing.

### Serial Signal

The BMInator MUST output and input a serial stream of 921600 Baud, with 8 data bits, No parity and 1 Stop bit over J2(IO) pins X/Y (uC function PA9/PA10) for an effective Byte rate of 92160 Bytes per second.  In accordance with standard serial bit stream protocols, the LSB is transmitted first on the wire.

### Packets and Messages

The BMInator sends and receives data grouped in packets of up to 1024 bytes, preceded by a header, a length and followed by a simple checksum.  

Packets must either contain multiple event messages (output) or a single command (input) or acknowledgement (output) message. 

Packets may be zero padded to fill up a predefined total packet length, so that the header and length can be sent before streaming the messages with minimal latency.

| Content             | Description                                                                     |
| :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0x49 0x52 0x4F 0x4E | a magic header consisting of the ASCII characters 'I','R','O','N' in that order |
| uint16              | a big endian 16 bit byte count, up to 1024, of the following messages           |
| messages            | a sequence of messages as defined below                                         |
| uint16              | a crc16 all message bytes as defined below                                      |

Packet Format

The CRC is computed with the xmodem polynomial 0x1021, initial value 0, no reflection or xoring, and appended MSB first (big-endian).

#### Message Format

Event messages are in a format close to a CoaXPress Event Message or a CoaXPress Tagged Command or Acknowledgement Message for ease of forwarding encapsulated in a CoaXPress Event Packet or in a CoaXPress Tagged Command or Tagged Acknowledgement Packet.

All relevant aspects are reproduced here, so the CoaXpress standard need not be consulted.

Transmission is organized in groups of 4 characters called a word, labelled P0, P1, P2, P3, transmitted in that order on the wire.
When 16, 24 or 32 bit quantities are encoded in a word, the order of the bytes within the word is big-endian.  
A 64 bit quantity is transmitted as 2 words, in big-endian order

| Value    | P0       | P1       | P2       | P3       |
| :------- | :------- | :------- | :------- | :------- |
| 4x8 bit  | b0[0:7]  | b1[0:7]  | b2[0:7]  | b3[0:7]  |
| 2x16 bit | h0[8:15] | h0[0:7]  | h1[8:15] | h1[0:7]  |
| 1x32 bit | w[24:31] | w[16:23] | w[8:15]  | w[0:7]   |
| 1x64 bit | v[56:63] | v[48:55] | v[40:47] | v[32:39] |
|          | v[24:31] | v[16:23] | v[8:15]  | v[0:7]   |

Example big-endian encoding of four 8-, two 16-, one 32- or 64-bit values in Words.

####  Command Messages (input)

A packet may contain a single command message with the following layout:
| Word           | Content (hex) | Description                                            |
| :------------- | :------------ | :----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0              | 05 05 05 05   | Control command indication – with tag.                 |
| 1              | 4x Tag        | To be repeated in reply (see below).                   |
| 2              | Cmd           | Bit 31..24: 0x00 Memory read, 0x01 Memory write        |

Acknowledgment messages are sent in reply to a command.

Since 0x06060606 is not a valid Word 0 for the Event Messages defined below, the first word in a packet can be used
to determine if a packet contains a single 

#### Event Messages (output)

A packet may contain multiple event messages with the following layout:

| Word     | Content          | Description                                                                                      |

Event message format -- cf CoaXPress Standard Version 2.1 p.68 Table 29.

Note: The BMInator does not emit events larger than 32 bytes.

Note: The Timestamp field is filled in by the BMInator microcontroller referenced to its internal clock, with no relation to the Host Unit's internal clock. Strictly speaking this is not conform the CoaXPress standard.

The BMInator generates messages with the following ID (Namespace + EventID) and contents

Event Message types. 

Note: the BMInator will send only one of the message types 0x032..0x35 and of 0x038..0x3c, depending on the current sensitiviy setting of its Gyroscope and Accelerometer components.  
The eventid encodes the full scale value of the int16 numbers as per the BMI085 datasheet.

Event types 0x23 and 0x25 have a timestamp recorded in the Event Message header as described above. They are sent at the Host Unit frame rate. Their payload is a continuously incremented counter.

The bandwidth will be dominated by the 3600Hz messages of 20 bytes each, or 72 kB/s, taking up 720 kBaud on the serial line, about or 80%. 

The two padding bytes in the ACCEL and GYRO messages may be set to zero or may be used for an error correction code on the payload, TBD(lvd).

The streaming event messages are all exactly 20 bytes in length to ease the framing and de-framing as described above. 

The 4 sampled channels in the ADC message are, in order:

| Chan | Signal                |
| ---- | --------------------- |
| 0    | Vref                  |
| 9    | pin PA4 thermistor    |
| 11   | pin PA6 current sense |
| 17   | internal temperature  |

### Command Address Space

The Command/Acknowledge packets allow the host unit to control the bminator by reading and writing registers.
The BMInator defines the following address layout, within a prefix meant to deconflict the host unit's own address space.

| Address range      | r/w | Semantics                         |

### Firmware updates

The firmware exists in 2 copies, selected by a small bootloader in flash.  The active copy of the firmware
has a facility to update the alternate copy through the write command.  The bootloader checks the crc32
of both images and boots the one with the highest serial number.

TODO define crc32 and serial number.
